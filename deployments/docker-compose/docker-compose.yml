# Docker-compose is a tool used to orchestrate the deployment of services.
# We can define and run multi-container docker applications.

# https://docs.docker.com/network/
# networks are used to connect services through IP.
# The default driver which is used is the "bridge":
#   "bridge network is a Link Layer device which forwards traffic between network segments"
#   https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/
networks:
  # Edge networks are the outer preimeter nodes of the network.
  # These nodes are "fully" accessible to the public through eg. HTTP, grpc, and so on.
  edge_net:
    driver: bridge
  # In contrast to the "edge"-network the "backend" is not directly accessible to the public
  # for the public to access the backend they are most ofently required to access it though
  # a reverse proxy found on the "edge"-network
  backend_net:
    driver: bridge
